## Positive

- native development with Apache, MySQL and PHP
- pretty and feature-rich file explorer (Nemo)
- many customization options for the start bar
- very nice GUI (Cinnamon Themes, ePapirus, Nemo)
- Software Manager
- good partition manager
- beautiful wallpapers
- useful disk usage analyzer
- updates only in the background
- integration for the google account

## Negative

- standard theme and icons are ugly
- no autoscroll in Google Chrome
  - There is a [Chrome plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autoscroll/occjjkgifpmdgodlplnacmkejpdionan?hl=de) that adds this function, but it is very buggy and I cannot recommend it
  - There is a [chrome flag](https://medium.com/@1nikolas/linux-enable-middle-mouse-button-scrolling-on-chrome-ium-and-electron-apps-discord-etc-ab2d0a213505), but it has an annoying warning message as a side effect. The flag is often removed automatically.
- video editing not really possible
  - DaVinci Resolve does not have H.264, H.265 and AAC codec support
  - other codes or video editing programs are a solution
- only a few supported games
