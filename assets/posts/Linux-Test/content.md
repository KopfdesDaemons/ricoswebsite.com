## positive

- native development with Apache, MySQL and PHP
- pretty file explorer (nemo)
- many customization options for the start bar
- very nice GUI (Cinnamon Adapta-Nokto, ePapirus, nemo)
- Software Manager
- good partition manager

## negative

- no autoscroll in Google Chrome
    - There is a [Chrome plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autoscroll/occjjkgifpmdgodlplnacmkejpdionan?hl=de) that adds this function, but it is very buggy and I cannot recommend it
    - There is a [chrome flag](https://medium.com/@1nikolas/linux-enable-middle-mouse-button-scrolling-on-chrome-ium-and-electron-apps-discord-etc-ab2d0a213505), but it has an annoying warning message as a side effect. The flag is often removed automatically.
- exif data view in explorer is poor
    - video resolution and bitrate cannot be displayed
- default audio output cannot be set easily and reliably
    - the application PulseAudio helps limited
- video editing not really possible
    - DaVinci Resolve does not have h264 codec support
- only a few supported games
    - Steam settings are bugged
- Graphics glitch in cinnamon after starting from standby mode
    - Restarting cinnamon helps: Press "Ctrl" + "F2", Type "r", Press "Enter"
